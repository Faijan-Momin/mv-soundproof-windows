                    How Soundproof Windows Work to Reduce Noise
                    MV Soundproof Windows do not Remove or Replace Your Existing Windows
                    MV Soundproof Windows rehabilitate your existing windows!! There is no
                    need for window replacement. Besides reducing noise, our soundproof
                    windows can solve other window problems.
                    MV soundproof windows are second windows placed behind your existing
                    windows. Our windows insulate, stop drafts, soundproof and more. They
                    open and close just like your existing windows, and offer more benefits than
                    replacement windows – at a significantly lower cost.
                    No construction mess or down time to install our soundproof windows. No
                    hassle installation takes only hours per room to install our soundproof
                    windows. Simple, straightforward and fast. Also, a very clean installation
                    with little, if any, mess.
                    Many custom colors.
                    
                    Our soundproof windows allow you to change the inside appearance of your
                    windows without changing the outside appearance. Available in many
                    custom colors (at an additional cost), MV soundproof windows soften the
                    often harsh brown-bronze color or appearance of your current windows.
                    Soundproof Windows can reduce the current noise levels by 95% or by 75%,
                    and both statements will be true: one is the instrument measurement, while
                    the other is the perceived noise reduction. Additionally, depending on actual
                    noise levels, the noise reduction may be perceived as 100%.
                    It is very expensive to get a perceived noise reduction of anything more than
                    20% with even window. The maximum available perceived noise reduction
                    still does not exceed 50% and this number can not help you in Having a
                    peaceful environment in your homes. So the best option is to Acquire MV
                    Soundproof windows.
                    MV Soundproof Windows do significantly MORE and cost significantly LESS
